ðŸš² Cyclistic Bike-Share App Data Analysis


## 1 Goals
This project analyzes the differences in bicycle usage between Annual Members and Casual Riders of the Cyclistic bike-share program. The primary business goal is to identify distinct behavioral patterns that will inform a new marketing strategy aimed at maximizing annual membership conversions.
So the main questions to answer are:

- What is the overall distribution of our user types (Members vs. Casuals)?

- Which user group is the most active in terms of total ride volume?

- What are the key differences in ride duration for each group? 

- How does the usage vary across the days of the week for each user type?

- How does hourly usage distribution differ between Members and Casual Riders?
